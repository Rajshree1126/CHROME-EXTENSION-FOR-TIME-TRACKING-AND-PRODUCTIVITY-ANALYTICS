## üìÜ Use Case Scenario

Imagine you're a student studying remotely. You install this extension to keep yourself accountable. During your study sessions, you mark educational sites like Khan Academy and Coursera as productive, and social media as unproductive. At the end of the week, you open the dashboard and notice that 40% of your time was lost on unproductive sites. You then use the blocking feature to limit social media to 15 minutes per day, improving your focus and study time significantly.

This tool is also ideal for remote workers, freelancers, or anyone interested in self-monitoring their web activity to boost productivity.
